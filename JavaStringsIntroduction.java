 "A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." â€” Wikipedia: String (computer science)

This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:

String myString = "Hello World!"
The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.

Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:

Sum the lengths of A and B.
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before  in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Input Format
The first line contains a string . The second line contains another string . The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of  and .
For the second line, write Yes if  is lexicographically greater than  otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both  and  and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input 0
hello
java

Sample Output 0
9
No
Hello Java

Explanation 0
String A is "hello" and B is "java".
A has a length of 5, and B has a length of 4; the sum of their lengths is .
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore, A is not greater than B and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".
